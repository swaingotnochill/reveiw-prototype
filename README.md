## Prototype Review

This tool acts as a preliminary layer to get suggestions for both the owner and the reviewer of the PR.

### Improvements and Feedback.

- Rajeev: 1. Summary of changes made.
          2. Check coding standards(this vary  from org to org, some standard coding format(gpt can take care of this)).


### Will u use it? If yes, why? If no, why?

- Rajeev: Yes. But only when if its freely available or if org provides. It will speed up the review process.
